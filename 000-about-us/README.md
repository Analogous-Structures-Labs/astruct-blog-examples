# An Introduction to Analogous Structures Labs and first topic: Trying Poetry

Hello, random internet stranger. Welcome to the blog of Analogous Structures Labs. We created this blog as a place to jot down random ideas encountered while working on our various projects, generalized and simplified for easy consumption. In most cases, these ideas have come up while working with tools that are new to us or new features of tools we have used before. In some cases, we weren't able to find clear examples that answered our questions so we created our own solutions and are sharing them here.

We anticipate that some posts will build on previous ones and we'll try to point out when they do. Any example code included in posts will be available in a public GitHub repo to which we'll link in the post. Feel free to engage, comment, ask questions, hurl insults, etc. We're not married nor religious about any of these ideas nor any of the examples. They are at best proofs of concept, experiments.

We make no warranty or guarantees regarding these code examples. We're not endorsing any idea based on the idea's quality, viability, nor its desirability as a solution unless specifically stated. You're free to use the example code, in whole or in part, if you feel they'd be useful to you in something you are building or trying out. But they are essentially presented as toys. There are no guarantees that anything in the examples is the best practice, best solution, or even a good solution. We don't purport to be authorities in all (or even any) of the technologies utilized herein. In fact, there are clear areas where we take shortcuts for the sake of simplicity or brevity and we'll attempt to call those out. In other cases, you'll notice we have no idea what we're doing and welcome suggestions on better approaches.

If you're interested in having a deeper conversation on a specific project of yours, whether you're incorporating ideas from one of our posts or not, feel free to reach out.

On with the show.
